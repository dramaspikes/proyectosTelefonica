# proyectosTelefonica

These are various projects that I've put together for the Fundación Telefónica's JavaScript Programming course. Some code has been left as comments as previous steps or alternate solutions to the problems at hand. In some cases, I've added extra functionality to the programs, beyond the scope of the exercise. 

The main functionality of the programs are as follows:

Caso1/Case1: DOM Manipulation - Obtains all <p> elements and alerts them, adds on a child <p> element.

Caso2/Case2: Example JSON Structure

Caso3/Case3: Reads an XML file via AJAX request and puts its contents on the main page, when button is pressed.

Caso4/Case4: Reads a JSON file via AJAX request and puts its contents on the main page, when button is pressed.
  
Caso5/Case5: Uses stringify and parse to carry out their respective actions on a JSON object and JavaScript object, showing results in the console.
  
Caso6/Case6: Uses JQuery to make text in fields change color on focus.
  
Caso7/Case7: Uses JQuery to highlight <p> elements of more than 100 characters.
  
Caso8/Case8: Uses AngularJS Directives and AJAX to read data from a JSON object and filter it via a search field.
  
Caso9/Case9: Uses AngularJS Directives to react to user input on a multiple-choice test, changing color and text as the user answers.
  
Caso10/Case10: Creates a Node.JS server and client which, when any file name is concatinated with the domain name, is able to retreive and serve that file. 
  
Caso11/Case11: Uses event emitters in Node.JS to listen for user interaction with a sample radio station whose information is stored in a object. Upon opening the app, and some seconds later, a message is logged in the console.
  
Caso12/Case12: Uses Node.JS to create a local file, count the lines present in the file, copy its contents into a new file, and delete the original file.
